# ``D2LKit``

Communicate easily with a D2L Brightspace server

## Overview

This package provides a an expressive way to communicate with the Brightspace API.
D2L offers numerous SDKs for communicating with their API, but do not offer one for Swift. 
This package aims to solve that, and adds more functionality, like preset API calls for common routes.

The package is based on the [Valence Java SDK](https://github.com/Brightspace/valence-sdk-java), but has been rewritten in a more Swift-like style.
